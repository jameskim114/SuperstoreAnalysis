# SuperstoreAnalysis

## Project Description
To conclude my Data Analytics Certificate with BrainStation, my colleagues and I were tasked with finding, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset of our choice. In line with our interests and career goals, we took sales data from an online office supplies retailer (found on Kaggle) and created a hypothetical scenario surrounding it. As data analysts of the Superstore, we were tasked to find an optimal location for our first in-person store launch. 

All of the details of this project, from the scenario to our final conclusions, can be found in this [Google Slides Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1APxvMKjTnznA0EEGU8xtdQFzLBNTGqUfuXl7RCE51-c/edit?usp=sharing). Please refer to the speaker notes for full details and a walkthrough of each step in the process!  

Big shoutout to Andrew, Jayden, and Suganya, you guys made this project so enjoyable to do :)
